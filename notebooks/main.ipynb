As early as the 1820\\u2019s, hounds gone \\u2018wild\\u2019 posed a significant threat to public order and livestock, prompting some of the world\\u2019s earliest Dog Acts to corral, castrate and kill unwanted canines.

Roving snake showmen and antidote sellers employed \\u2018curs\\u2019 and pets alike to demonstrate the fatal effects of envenomation and, all going well, the efficacy of their remedies. Into the 1880\\u2019s, the frequency and prominence of these lay experiments set public standards of proof, which materially affected the claims and conduct of colonial doctors in treating snakebite. Being responsible for controlling unlicensed strays, regulating public performances and recording violent deaths, colonial police were constantly at the centre of these exhibitions of animal suffering.

We\\'re so grateful to all of you who have taken the time to share, comment and research these images over the last few years. All our digitised content - these photographs and many thousands more -  is also available on our online catalogue. \\n\\nThis image was taken around 1892 by Major Ruttledge-Fair for James Hack Tuke, who was campaigning for improved living conditions in Donegal and Connemara. As lots of you will know, many of our photographs feature a dog lurking around somewhere if you look closely enough, but the one here actually got his own note on the back: &quot;The dogs are to be seen flying out of sight if Police come in sight, in order to escape the dog-tax. This is quite a common fact. They are taught to do it, of course and they never make the mistake of running home.&quot;\\n\\nPhotographer: Major Ruttledge-Fair\\n\\nDate: Circa 1892\\n\\nNLI Ref: <a href=\"http://catalogue.nli.ie/Record/vtls000230537\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">TUKE9</a>'},\n",
