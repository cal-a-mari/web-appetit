web-appetit
===========
A mobile web application that helps users find good nearby dishes to eat by browsing through pictures. Often people  donâ€™t know which restaurant to eat at, so we want to let users browse through photos of tasty-looking dishes to find something good and then help give them directions to where to buy the dish.
